# Zombie Preparedness

Zombie-preparedness is a React application built for demonstration purposes. It utilizes the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) for design implementation. Other features include responsive design, JSON encoded page content with a markup preprocessor to allow for rapid changes to page content and structure, and near full test-coverage for the entire application.


## Getting started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner.\

## Additional Improvements

If more time was available, here are some additional features that would have been worthwhile to explore:
- An even more dynamic JSON page structure, so entire pages, and not just their content, can be built dynamically with pure JSON without needing to edit the page components themselves.
- Working signup features (right now a dummy form is provided, but it cannot be submitted).
- Multi-language support. Given the dynamic JSON structure, it should not be too difficult to translate page content into other languages and allow for swapping via the UI.
- Addtional page content. Currently, only Homepage, Preparedness 101 page, and a Task Force Sign-up page are included. But more pages could have been added to provide more detailed information on zombie survival, zombie physiology, and resources to help invdividuals prepare.
- A more unique brand identity. Currently, the site remains very close to the default recommended design for USWDS, but given the unique and grave nature of content explored in the site, a more unique brand design may be appropriate. This would help set aside the USDSD (US Department of Supernatural Defense) as a more singular element within the US Government which deals with the critical nature of supernatural threats in it's own unique way.
